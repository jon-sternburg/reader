There are two remarkable elements to this quotation. First, Esther seems to be aware that she is telling this story in tandem with someone else. She says that these pages will be “my portion,” suggesting that she knows that the tale is not entirely hers. Although Esther never refers to the third-person narrator with whom she shares the telling of Bleak House, she is aware of him, and she goes on to tell her story with the understanding that someone else will flesh out the names, places, and events that she refers to from her limited, first-person perspective.Esther says she knows she is “not clever,” but this assertion alerts us to the fact that she is indeed clever and will tell the story in a skillful way. Even though the beginning of her narration does seem to lack the finesse and dramatic touches that characterize her later chapters, her claim to be “not clever” quickly shows itself to be false. Esther has an intuitive, compassionate way of interacting with the world, and as we get to know her, we see that, at times, she knows more than she lets on. This quotation, rather than telling us that our narrator isn’t smart, tells us that our narrator perhaps isn’t fully reliable. We can trust Esther to tell the full story, but, as we will see as the novel progresses, she will tell us the story on her own terms, deciding for herself what to reveal and when to reveal it.","page":"http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/bleakhouse/quotes/","sd":"np-1"},{"section":"","cfi":"epubcfi(/6/20!/4/98,/1:269,/1:369)","quote":"It was grand to see how the wind awoke, and bent the trees, and drove the rain before it like a clou","desc":"This quotation appears in chapter 18, “Lady Dedlock,” one week after Esther saw Lady Dedlock for the first time and felt a strange connection to her. Esther, Ada, and Mr. Jarndyce, who are visiting Mr. Boythorn in Lincolnshire, wait out a violent storm in a keeper’s lodge, and Esther makes these observations as she looks out from the doorway. This is not the first time Esther has contemplated that she has benefited from the kindness of others or even from “tremendous powers,” but the placement of this particular meditation is significant since it follows her first sighting of Lady Dedlock. The storm seems to be significantly timed, as if the seeing Lady Dedlock for the first time shook the world itself. The storm suggests a disruption or a disturbance, mirroring in larger form the violent beating of Esther’s heart when she spotted Lady Dedlock in the church. Although Esther’s observations are idle and content, there is an element of suspense, even foreboding, to the storm.Immediately after Esther makes these observations, Lady Dedlock speaks to the group—unbeknownst to them, she had been in the lodge as well. She greets Esther indifferently and seems to ignore her, but her coldness takes on new meaning when we eventually discover Lady Dedlock’s secret. Indeed, it is the discovery of this secret along with the violent events that follow it that will ultimately shape Esther’s life most dramatically.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/bleakhouse/quotes/page/3","sd":""},{"section":"","cfi":"epubcfi(/6/60!/4/144[c66]/28,/1:0,/1:100)","quote":"Thus Chesney Wold. With so much of itself abandoned to darkness and vacancy; with so little change u","desc":"This quotation concludes chapter 66, “Down in Lincolnshire,” as well as the third-person narrator’s portion of the novel. In the paragraph that precedes this quotation, the narrator tells us that Chesney Wold is so desolate that people are afraid to walk in it by themselves and that a maid became so depressed that she couldn’t stay there. Here, the narrator concludes his description of Chesney Wold’s deathlike state. When he says simply “Thus Chesney Wold,” he seems to dismiss the home from all chance of hope or revival: it is this way now, and it will be this way forever. The narrator personifies the house to some extent, calling it “abandoned,” “sombre,” and “motionless” and says that it is in “repose.” This strategy is also a way for the narrator to step back from the story he’s been telling and sum up the fates of all those who once lived here. By not focusing in on one particular person, the narrator seems to suggest that the inhabitants of Chesney Wold have all become rather ghostlike themselves, rattling around the empty, echoing rooms without much purpose.The “passion and pride” the narrator refers to connect most poignantly to Sir Leicester. A great, indomitable man, Sir Leicester was finally destroyed by the loss of Lady Dedlock. He fought it to the last and hoped she’d return, but to no avail. He is a changed, weakened man, who, like Chesney Wold itself, has been abandoned and exists in the same listless state throughout summer and winter. The conclusion of the narrator’s tale is grim, and, as Esther resumes her tale in chapter 67 by discussing how happy she and Bleak House are, Chesney Wold seems to fade and finally disappear completely.","page":"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/bleakhouse/quotes/page/5","sd":""}]
